## Overview of Project: 
This project uses javascript and html coding to create an HTML page that can be accessed by the user and filtered based on input fields.

## Results: 
The final product of this project is a fully functional, sleek, user input form which can take that user input and then monitor changes using the background javascript coding.

# How do we use this page? Here is a walkthrough of the page and usability.

Upon loading the page initially, you can see that the table preloaded with UFO Sightings data from 1/1/2010. Each user input field has a 'filler' string to allow the user to input the formatting that is read. This matches data fields in the background files.

As the user hits the 'Enter' key, the code reads the change and updates the table based on the input. In the attached image, user input is '1/10/2010'.

Any field can be updated in this way, with a search for 'Date and Shape' both possible. The following are single user input and multiple user input.

## Summary: 
The biggest drawback to this project is that the user cannot tell where the data comes from, or whether it is confirmed, if there are multiple reports of the same occurrence, etc. Obviously sources and multiple sightings would lend itself to better validated data.

A few good additions to this project would be a data scraper function so that the user can grab updated information, a search by 'length' of occurrence, and a link to sources.
